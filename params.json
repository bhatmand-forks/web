{"name":"IERG4210, CUHK (2014-15 Term 2)","tagline":"Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong","body":"## IERG4210 Web Programming and Security\r\nThis course studies the programming and security of web applications. The programming languages for both client- and server-side will be introduced, with security design principles and common vulnerabilities highlighted early on. Open standards and real-world case studies will be used for illustrations. Optimization and performance issues will also be covered. This course also extends to the security threats confronting web browsers, transport layer protocols and web servers, as well as mobile and cloud computing if time permits. Each student will have the opportunity to practice by building and securing an e-commerce website, and finally assess the security of one another's website with a peer-hacking experiment.\r\n\r\n### Learning Outcomes\r\n* Demonstrate understanding of the principles and techniques in the design and development of secure web applications.\r\n* Appraise and be inspired on how the web, ranging from browsers to servers, can be attacked and better secured.\r\n* Raise security awareness throughout the development of web applications as well as other engineering practices.\r\n\r\n### Assignment\r\nThe assignment is to provide students with chances to code and practice what were learned from the course. Students are required to design and build an e-commerce shopping website, which deserves more security protections than average websites like blogs. The assignment is split into 7 phases (roughly biweekly). Each student is required to build and secure their own website, which comprises a front-end that accepts online purchases through Paypal, and an admin panel that manages the product listings. The website is then securely configured and hosted live on the Amazon AWS Cloud Server. Most excitingly, the last phase will allow students to challenge the security measures implemented on each others' website.\r\n\r\n### Tentative Assessment Scheme\r\n* Assignments\t35%\r\n* Online Revision Quizzes\t5%\r\n* Mid-term Exam\t20%\r\n* Final Exam\t40%","google":"UA-23136362-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
